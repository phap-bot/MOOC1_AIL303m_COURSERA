Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Definition:
- EDA is an approach to analyzing data sets that summarizes their main characteristics, often using visual methods.
- Helps determine if data is usable as-is or needs further cleaning.

Importance:
- Identifies patterns.
- Observes trends.
- Helps formulate hypotheses.

Common techniques:
- Summary statistics.
- Visualizations.
Feature Engineering & Variable Transformation
Purpose:
- Transforming variables helps meet assumptions of statistical models.
- Example: In linear regression, transform predictors to create a linear relation with target.

Common transformations:
- Log transformations.
- Polynomial features.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling variables.
