AI / ML / DL Notes
AI Concepts
AI: machines mimic human intelligence (learn, solve problems).
ML: machines learn from data (no step-by-step coding).
DL: ML with multi-layer neural nets, learns from big data.
History & Applications
History: AI booms & winters.
Applications: speech, vision, health, robots…
Modern AI: big data, fast computers, open-source, diverse neural networks.
ML Workflow
Problem → Collect data → Preprocess → Model → Validate → Deploy
Taxonomy
target = what to predict
features = inputs
example = one data row
label = target value of example
