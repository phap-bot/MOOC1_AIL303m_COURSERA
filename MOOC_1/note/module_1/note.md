1. Concepts & Relationships

Artificial Intelligence (AI): Any system that can sense â€“ reason â€“ act â€“ adapt.

Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI where machines learn from data to improve behavior.

Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML using multi-layer neural networks to handle complex tasks.

2. History & Development

AI has gone through many ups and downs in terms of funding and expectations.

Recent progress comes from computing power + big data + DL, which broke the limits of classical ML.

3. Major Breakthroughs

Image Processing: Since 2015, computers classify images (e.g., dog vs. cat) better than humans.

Machine Translation: Not just word-by-word but learning sentence structure and phrasing, approaching human-level quality.

4. Impact & Applications

AI is compared to electricity 100 years ago, transforming every major industry.

Real-world applications:

Targeted advertising

Supply chain optimization & retail

Self-driving cars

Smart homes (voice commands, entertainment, security)

5. Key Definitions

Merriam-Webster: A branch of computer science simulating intelligent behavior.

Wikipedia: Machines mimicking human cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving.

Example of AI outside ML/DL: Rule-based systems (do not learn from data).


Machine Learning Overview (Summary)
1. Definition

ML = programs that learn patterns from data instead of hard-coded rules.

More data â†’ better learning (but with diminishing returns).

2. Key Concepts

Features: Input variables (e.g., petal length, sepal width).

Target: What we predict (e.g., iris species).

3. Types of ML

Supervised Learning (with labels): Predict outcomes.

Example: Spam filter, Fraud detection.

Unsupervised Learning (no labels): Find hidden structure.

Example: Customer segmentation.

ðŸ“· Customer segmentation clusters

4. Applications

Fraud Detection: Flag unusual credit card transactions.
ðŸ“· Fraud detection concept

Customer Segmentation: Group users for marketing.

âœ… Conclusion:
ML (subset of AI) learns from data â†’ Features + Target are core â†’ 2 main types: Supervised (prediction) & Unsupervised (clustering).
