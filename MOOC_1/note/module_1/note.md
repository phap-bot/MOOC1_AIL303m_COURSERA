1. Concepts & Relationships

Artificial Intelligence (AI): Any system that can sense – reason – act – adapt.

Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI where machines learn from data to improve behavior.

Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML using multi-layer neural networks to handle complex tasks.

2. History & Development

AI has gone through many ups and downs in terms of funding and expectations.

Recent progress comes from computing power + big data + DL, which broke the limits of classical ML.

3. Major Breakthroughs

Image Processing: Since 2015, computers classify images (e.g., dog vs. cat) better than humans.

Machine Translation: Not just word-by-word but learning sentence structure and phrasing, approaching human-level quality.

4. Impact & Applications

AI is compared to electricity 100 years ago, transforming every major industry.

Real-world applications:

Targeted advertising

Supply chain optimization & retail

Self-driving cars

Smart homes (voice commands, entertainment, security)

5. Key Definitions

Merriam-Webster: A branch of computer science simulating intelligent behavior.

Wikipedia: Machines mimicking human cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving.

Example of AI outside ML/DL: Rule-based systems (do not learn from data).


Machine Learning Overview (Summary)
1. Definition

ML = programs that learn patterns from data instead of hard-coded rules.

More data → better learning (but with diminishing returns).

2. Key Concepts

Features: Input variables (e.g., petal length, sepal width).

Target: What we predict (e.g., iris species).

3. Types of ML

Supervised Learning (with labels): Predict outcomes.

Example: Spam filter, Fraud detection.

Unsupervised Learning (no labels): Find hidden structure.

Example: Customer segmentation.

4. Applications

Fraud Detection: Flag unusual credit card transactions.

Customer Segmentation: Group users for marketing.

 Conclusion:
ML (subset of AI) learns from data → Features + Target are core → 2 main types: Supervised (prediction) & Unsupervised (clustering).

 History of Artificial Intelligence (Summary in English)
1950s – The Birth of AI

1950: Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test to evaluate machine intelligence.

1956: Dartmouth Conference – AI officially recognized as a field.

1957: Frank Rosenblatt invented the Perceptron, precursor to neural networks.

1959: Arthur Samuel developed a checkers program and popularized the term Machine Learning.

1960s–1970s – First AI Winter

Machine translation (Russian ↔ English) failed to meet expectations.

Marvin Minsky (1969) showed limits of perceptron.

James Lighthill Report (1973) led to major funding cuts.

Result: First AI Winter (loss of funding & interest).

1980s – The Rise of Expert Systems

Businesses adopted rule-based expert systems.

AI reached industry for the first time.

Geoffrey Hinton and colleagues introduced Backpropagation → foundation for deep learning.

Late 1980s–1990s – Second AI Winter

Expert systems failed to scale and often made mistakes.

Neural networks could not handle large datasets.

Investments declined again → Second AI Winter.

2000s–Present – Machine Learning & Deep Learning Boom

ML successes: speech recognition, search engines, fraud detection.

Deep Learning breakthroughs:

2012: AlexNet revolutionized image classification.

Machine translation reached near-human performance.

AI now impacts healthcare, autonomous vehicles, smart homes, advertising, and more.

Today’s AI Landscape – Summary
Why this era is different
