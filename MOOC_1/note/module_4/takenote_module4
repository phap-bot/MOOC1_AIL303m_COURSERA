Estimation, Inference & Hypothesis Testing
Estimation and Inference
Inferential Statistics:
- Learn population characteristics from a sample.
- Population characteristics = parameters.
- Sample characteristics = statistics.
- Parametric models use parameters like mean and standard deviation.

Estimation:
- Common method: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
- Estimation = determining population parameter from fitted model.

Distributions:
- Uniform, Normal, Log-normal, Exponential, Poisson.

Approaches:
- Frequentist: many experiment repetitions.
- Bayesian: parameters described by probability distributions.
Hypothesis Testing
Definitions:
- Hypothesis: statement about a population parameter.
- Null hypothesis (H0) vs. Alternative hypothesis (H1).
- Hypothesis test = decision rule for accepting or rejecting H0.

Errors:
- Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (false positive).
- Type II error: fail to reject H0 when it is false (false negative).
Significance Level & p-values
- Significance level: threshold (e.g., 0.01, 0.05) chosen before test.
- p-value: smallest significance level at which H0 would be rejected.
- Confidence interval: values of statistic where we accept H0.
Correlations
- Correlation can help predict outcomes but does not imply causation.
- Consider confounding variables before making recommendations.
- Spurious correlations may appear due to coincidences in data
